# 27016_Design-Build_1_Devices_for_measuring_cell_growth
Material for the course 27016 Design-Build 1: Devices for measuring cell growth (Jan 22) at DTU. The project was focused on measuring the growth of yeast cells. The program, written in MicroPython, was used to collect data from a Huzzah board during the experiments. Additionally, tools for analyzing data and creating graphs are available, with test data provided for reference. 

Here is a picture of the final circuit:
